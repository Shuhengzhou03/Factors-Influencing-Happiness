By focusing on variables such as income, marital status, education level, job satisfaction, and the number of children, it examines their respective roles in shaping individual well-being. The findings underscore the significance of these factors, illustrating how socioeconomic conditions and personal attributes interact to influence happiness. This analysis offers a clearer perspective on the primary predictors of well-being, with meaningful implications for enhancing both individual and societal happiness.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
